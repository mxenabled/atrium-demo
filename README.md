A web app that consumes the Atrium API from MX to allow users to pull in multiple accounts from multiple financial instutitions so they can easily view all of their balances and transactions in one place.


Main Objectives:

1. Hoping to get a better understanding of how the Atrium API works from an outside developers perspective. 

2. Using this as an opportunity to improve the client onbaording for Atrium by tracking and highlighting issues that I encounter and reporting them back so we an improve the experience of clients Whether from unclear or outdated information in the documentation. 

3. Seeing if this type of project would be useful for future employee onboarding on the API team. 

4. Hoping to get some good experience and confidence from this project!
